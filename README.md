# Countdown Word Game
A word game resembling the Channel 4 Countdown game show.

The app is served by my [word-game-api](https://github.com/tsunghotang/word-game-api).

This project was built in Rails to gain a better understanding and practical experience with StimulusJS, AJAX in Rails, JBuilder and Service Objects.
